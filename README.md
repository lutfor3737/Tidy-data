**Introduction:**

This repository contains the run_analysis scripts for the course of "Getting and cleaning data". I downloaded files from

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

**About the script**

I created run_analysis.R  which will merge and create tidy_date.txt and tidy_data_mean.txt in working directory.
